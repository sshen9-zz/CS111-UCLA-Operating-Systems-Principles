The tar file contains the following:
1. A selfie taken with my assembled beaglebone with the Grove Base Cape
2. Screenshot connected.png showing my configured network access and the name I gave my beaglebone
3. Copy.png that shows me copying helloworld.c to my beaglebone through scp
4. git.png that shows me successfully cloning a git repo onto my local environment. Note that git was already
installed so I didn't have to install it.
5. A makefile with a target dist that builds the tarball, and a target clean that removes the tarball.
6. This readme file
