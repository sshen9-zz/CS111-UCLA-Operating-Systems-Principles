This tarball includes:
	A C source file lab4b.c that runs on the beaglebone
	Makefile with targets:
		default to compile program
		check to run the check script that I wrote commtest.sh
		clean to remove the tarball and executable
		dist to create the tarball
	A README
	commtest.sh which is a simple bash script that tests basic functionality
	of the program and sees if it can communicate with the sensors
