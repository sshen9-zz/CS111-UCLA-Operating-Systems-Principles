CS111 Operating System Principles
Samuel Shen

This following repository contains my work from CS111.

Project 0: Basic C programming, POSIX file operations, process command line
arguments, create a basic Makefile

Project 1a: Termial I/O interprocess communication. Created a character-at-a-time
full duplex terminal I/O, polling I/O and passing input between two processes.

Project 1b: Continuation of 1a. Passing I/O over a TCP socket, and using Zlib
for compressed communication

Project 2a: Exploring various synchronization problems. Wrote multithreaded application
performing updates to a shared variable, and measured performance. Solved race conditions
with various synchronization methods, and compared performance.

Project 2b: Split up the data structures in part a into separate pieces, thus increasing
parallel access to resources. Analyzed performance and compared with part a.

Project 3a: File system interpretation: wrote a program to analyze the EXT2 file system,
(superblock, groups, free-lists, inodes, indirect blocks, and directories)

Project 3b: File system consistency analysis: analyze file system summaries in part a
to detect any anomalies

Project 4a: Configured Beaglebone IOT Green Wireless

Project 4b: Sensors Input. Create an application that runs on the Beaglebone, which reads
external sensors and logs results

Project 4c: Internet of Things Security. Extended program from part b to accept commands
from, and send reports back to, a network server, using both encrypted and unencrypted
channels.
