The tarball contains a file lab0.c which provides the code for copying text from an input source to an output source. It also contains 2 files which are
screenshots of the gdb debugger specified in the assignment. As for the smoke
test cases in the Makefile, I found it easier to run a bash script from the check target; the bash script is also included in the tarball and is named
sanity.sh.

For the actual C file, I ran into various problems while doing the assignment.
First, I needed to research all the different system calls for file manipulation.
I also ran into problems with the getopt_long function. To solve this, I looked
online in the manual page and utilized the example code they gave, which can
be found here:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Option-Example.html

For the sanity check test cases, I decided to include the following:
1. Check if the basic functionality was working with no options
2. Check if code works when adding valid input and output options
3. Check if the segfault and catch options return a valid code
4. Check if an unrecognized argument returns a valid code
5. Check if an error in the input option returns a valid code
6. Check if an error in creating the output file returns a valid code

All of these sanity test cases were relatively easy to implement within the bash
script and basically just test the various options and return codes specified
in the assignment. The only slightly complicated one was the output test; for the output
test, I created a file with no permissions, and I tested if
the creat(2) function would throw an error.
