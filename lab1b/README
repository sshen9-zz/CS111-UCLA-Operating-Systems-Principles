The contents of the tarball include:

    A file "lab1b-client.c" that takes in input from the keyboard,
    compresses it, and sends the input over via TCP to another process "lab1b-server.c".

    A file "lab1b-server.c" that takes in input from the client via TCP and
    sends it to a shell process that is forked using pipes. The server then gets the
    output from the shell process and sends it back to the client through the socket.

    A Makefile that contains the targets "default", which compiles both the C files,
    "clean", which removes the executables and the tarball, and "dist" which builds the tarball.

    This README file.

There were many challenges I came across when writing this project, most of which
came from the use of zlib, but also some with the TCP connection. My testing methodology
included the use of the provided test script, as well as my own terminal commands through
the client process to see if the output was as expected.
